# Thanks for stopping by!

Nevan here. ðŸ‘‹ I'm a design teacher based in Barcelona, Spain, and this is my collection of stuff related to my field(s?) of practice. If you're curious about what I teach, I'd recommend starting with the <a href="{{< ref "competencies" >}}">competencies list</a>, or <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">some of the projects</a> I like to assign.

## Interested in studying with me? ðŸŒ´

I teach short courses on product design at <a href="https://buttonschool.com">Button School</a>.

In the past, Iâ€™ve taught bootcamps for new UX and product designers. These were <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">project-based</a> classes, with the goal of preparing students to start their careers as junior-level product designers.
