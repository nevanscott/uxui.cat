# Welcome!

Generally speaking, I make a website for each cohort I teach. Peruse around to see what kinds of things we do in class, or take a look at <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">some of the projects</a> I like to assign.

## Interested in studying with me? ðŸŒ´

I teach a 9-week bootcamp on user experience and user interface design at <a href="http://www.ironhack.com/en/courses/ux-ui-design-bootcamp-learn-ux-design">Ironhack in Barcelona</a>.

Itâ€™s a <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">project-based</a> class, with the goal of preparing students to start their careers as junior-level UX designers. Itâ€™s a big commitment, but if youâ€™re ready for that, I would love to have you in class.
