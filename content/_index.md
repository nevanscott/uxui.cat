# Thanks for stopping by!

Nevan here. ðŸ‘‹ I'm a design teacher based in Barcelona, Spain, and this is my collection of stuff related to my field(s?) of practice. If you're curious about what I teach, I'd recommend starting with the <a href="{{< ref "competencies" >}}">competencies list</a>, or <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">some of the projects</a> I like to assign.

## Interested in studying with me? ðŸŒ´

I teach a 12-week bootcamp on product design at <a href="https://buttonschool.com">Button School in Barcelona</a> with VÃ­ctor Ventura.

Itâ€™s a <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">project-based</a> class, with the goal of preparing students to start their careers as junior-level product designers. Itâ€™s a big commitment, but if youâ€™re ready for that, we would love to have you in class.
