# ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!

My name is Nevan, and I'm a design teacher based in Barcelona, Spain, and this is my collection of stuff related to my field(s?) of study. If you're curious about what I teach, I'd recommend starting with the <a href="{{< ref "competencies" >}}">competencies list</a>, or <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">some of the projects</a> I like to assign.


## Interested in studying with me? ðŸŒ´

I teach a 9-week bootcamp on user experience and user interface design at <a href="http://www.ironhack.com/en/courses/ux-ui-design-bootcamp-learn-ux-design">Ironhack in Barcelona</a>.

Itâ€™s a <a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}">project-based</a> class, with the goal of preparing students to start their careers as junior-level UX designers. Itâ€™s a big commitment, but if youâ€™re ready for that, I would love to have you in class.
