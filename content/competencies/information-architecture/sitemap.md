title: Sitemap
incomplete: Not provided.
novice: A sitemap has been produced, but is either confusing to read, or has not effectively been used to determine a better overall site structure. Site structure may be too tied to the organization rather than the user mental model.
competent: Sitemap is shown with some clear, user-centered reasoning about why the site should be organized in this way.
proficient: Sitemap is easy to read and understand, with a key/legend as an aid. It is clear how the sitemap relates to users' mental models and also clear how the sitemap connected to design decisions with the product.
expert: In addition to the final sitemap, iterations on the sitemap are considered with clear reasoning for the changes made, from both a user and implementation perspective.
