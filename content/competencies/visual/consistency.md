title: Design consistency
incomplete: Design is inconsistent.
novice: Consistency is attempted but some things feel "off" without justification—maybe new type treatments or color.
competent: Design matches look and feel throughout—color, type, iconography, pattern, sizing, spacing, shape.
proficient: Design is seamlessly integrated. Everything joins together in a single unifying overall aesthetic.
expert: >
  Design is consistently applied throughout, but also coherent: the look, feel, brand, copy, interactions, and animations all harmonize.
