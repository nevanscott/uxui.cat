title: Usage of Color Palette
incomplete: Color usage has no relationship to a color palette.
novice: Color palette is used and applied throughout, but in ways that aren't working well. For example, text color on top of a surface color is inappropriate, colors may be overused, contrast may be insufficient in places, etc.
competent: Colors are used appropriately throughout, with attention to color contrast. Color is applied consistently to mean certain things to the user.
proficient: Colors are deployed very intentionally and meaningfully throughout, with attention to accessibility.
expert: Colors are used expressively without distracting from clarity.
