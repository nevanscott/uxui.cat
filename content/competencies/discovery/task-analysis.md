title: Task Analysis
incomplete: No task analysis evident.
novice: Task analysis mentioned or shown but it wasn't clear what insights were gained or how those insights informed the design.
competent: Task analysis was performed in a deliberate way and demonstrated a sensible level of detail for the project. At least some connections were made between findings from task analysis and design decisions.
proficient: Multiple tasks have been analyzed, considered and prioritized. Design decisions are thoroughly informed by a clear understanding of users' tasks and existing behaviors and processes.
expert: Other stakeholders have been incorporated into the process of analyzing users' tasks in order to increase ownership of insights. Findings from task analysis clearly map to relevant planning documents such as user flows or use cases. No doubts remain about which tasks are being performed, what users' motivations are, or how task goals are accomplished.
