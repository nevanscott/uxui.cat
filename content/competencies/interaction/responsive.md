title: Responsive Layout
incomplete: No responsiveness shown.
novice: Some responsiveness is shown, but for only 1 or 2 screens of the design. The layout patterns may be unconventional or impractical for a responsive design.
competent: Responsiveness is demonstrated and considered throughout the design. Attention has been paid to common responsive patterns for content and navigation.
proficient: Sizing and interface density is considered and appropriate across target devices. Feasibility of implementation has been considered or reviewed with a developer.
expert: The responsive design is sufficiently mocked up and documented so that a developer would be able to use what's provided to start building the website/product.
