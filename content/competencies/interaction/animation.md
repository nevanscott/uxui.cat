title: Interaction Animations
incomplete: No animations shown.
novice: At least one animation is shown, but the animation is not very thoughtfully incorporated into the design, or could be executed better.
competent: A few key animations have been considered, and are applied thoughtfully to support user understanding. They may need some improvement in terms of implementation.
proficient: Animation are well-considered and subtly integrated throughout. Animation adds to the product rather than distracts. Prototypes demonstrating the animations are well-executed and convincing (without errors).
expert: Animations have been tested and iterated upon. Animations align with users' mental model and also support the brand look and feel. When appropriate, sound effects have been considered which further enhance the experience.
