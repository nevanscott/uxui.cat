## Brief

You will be proposing a new mobile app designed to support forming (or breaking) a habit. Based on user research, you'll identify an opportunity for an app to improve people's day-to-day lives.

## Suggestions

* Use findings from surveys and interviews to identify pain points in people's lives to help determine a direction for your product. You should be trying to solve *real* people's *real* problems. **Don't start with a concept!**
* Interview people from outside of campus. Use your network to talk to people you don't really know. <small>(Try looking for second-degree connections.)</small>
* Don't forget to *test and iterate*! This will help you develop a prototype that has the kinks worked out of it.
* Test on paper *before* going digital.
* **Document as you go.** Take photos and collect artifacts from your work. Especially keep track of your changes as you iterate on your prototype.

## Presentation

Your presentation should answer the following questions:

1. What did your research show you?
2. What variations on your design did you explore?
3. How were your design decisions connected to your research findings?
4. How would a user operate your final design?
5. How did your design change based on testing with users?
6. What would you do differently next time?

## Prototype

For this project, use a digital design tool to make a mid-fidelity version of your prototype.

* Stick to grayscale <small>(use color only if needed to convey meaning)</small>
* Just use 1 font <small>(like [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) or [Public Sans](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+sans&t=osx))</small>
* Use representative text content <small>(no lorem ipsum)</small>
* Use boxes with Xs in place of images


## Suggested Schedule

<div class="schedule row">
  <div>

  ### Day 1

  * Choose a habit area to focus on
  * Plan the following days
  * Conduct 2–3 preliminary interviews
  * Prepare and send a survey
  </div>
  <div>

  ### Day 2

  * Prepare and conduct more interviews
  * Finish your research
  * Gather the results
  </div>
  <div>

  ### Day 3

  * Translate your research results in features
  * Sketch your concepts and conduct some concept testing
  * Make a first paper prototype
  * Prepare and run usability tests on your paper prototype
  * Iterate on paper and test again
  </div>
  <div>

  ### Day 4

  * Move from paper a low-fidelity prototype in your design tool
  * Test & iterate further
  * Hold a critique session with other designers
  </div>
  <div>

  ### Day 5

  * Clean up your prototype to medium fidelity
  * Finalize your slide deck
  * Practice your presentation
  * Present your work
  </div>
</div>


## Design report

For this project, you'll be delivering a presentation as well as submitting a written report. The report is an opportunity for you to document your process, findings, takeaways, and iterations. It's good practice to document as much as you can *while you work*, so we're starting that practice early to make it a habit. This will make your life much easier later when you start compiling a portfolio of your work.

We'll have time dedicated after the presentations of this project to write up the report.
