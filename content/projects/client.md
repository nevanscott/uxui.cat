## Brief

You and your team will have **two weeks** to design a digital product - either an app or a responsive website - based on a briefing from a real company. During this process you'll apply your own vision, research, findings, and the design process you’ve learned throughout the program.

This project being in groups will mimic a real life scenario. Take this opportunity to apply everything you've learned about teamwork and keep in mind all the feedback you've received during the course. Communication and organization are key to success!

Also, think about your portfolio and your job search coming soon! Your final project is the one that you will spend the most time in and where you can apply everything you've learned, so make sure you tackle the processes that you're more interested in, or need extra development.
